The aim of this project is to experiment and to test my knowledge about Python and how to use them coherently.
This project is by no means completed, I aim to add more features to it, such as showing graphs of the quadratic equation inputted, as well as letting users to click on any point of the line on the graph to see its x and y values.
My long-term goal is to deepen my understanding about Python, especially with its math modules.
